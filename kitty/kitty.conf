# Choose whether to use the system implementation of wcwidth() (used to
# control how many cells a character is rendered in).  If you use the system
# implementation, then kitty and any programs running in it will agree. The
# problem is that system implementations often are based on outdated unicode
# standards and get the width of many characters, such as emoji, wrong. So if
# you are using kitty with programs that have their own up-to-date wcwidth()
# implementation, set this option to no.
